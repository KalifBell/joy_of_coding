Problem Solving for Programmers 

1. IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM: " If I had and hour to slove a problem
I'd spend 55 minutes thinking aobut the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"
start with (context) all the relevant information that a developer needs to complete a task.
then the (issue) why is this a problem
then (why do I care) state why this is important 

2. RESEARCH AND REFINE THE PROBLEM: Research what others have done to solve the problem.  
It's encouraged to use other people code as a starting point.  Discuss issue with other programmers.
Break it down into sub problems.

3. PSEUDOCODE: a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm should do.
Focus on (logic) of the code NOT syntax.

4. TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases
before developing the actual code.  We write the test using (mock) data. Take the test through the 
(1.Red. Failing test) That forces me to thing about what im trying to do.  
(2. Green. Write code that makes it pass) Figure out how to do that thing that makes it pass 
(Purple.  Optimize it) Reflect on code and optimize it. 

5. IMPLEMENT: "Done is better than perfect" like a hackathon.  JUST GET IT WORKING!!!

6. REFLECT: Take a 15 min break and do something different.  My sub-conscious mind is still working
on the problem and the solution might come very quickly when I return.

7. TIPS ON IMPROVING CODE:
- improve readability 
- add comments 
- remove duplication
- optimize time/space complexity
- add error handling
